        Konidala Pawan Kalyan[3] (born Konidala Kalyan Babu; 2 September 1971[2]) is an Indian politician, actor and philanthropist, serving as the 10th Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh since June 2024. He is also the Minister of Panchayat Raj, Rural Development & Rural Water Supply; Environment, Forests, Science & Technology in the Government of Andhra Pradesh and an MLA representing the Pitapuram constituency. He is the founder and president of the Janasena Party.

As an actor, Kalyan is known for his distinctive style and mannerisms in Telugu cinema. He enjoys a substantial fanbase across the Telugu states, often described as "unfathomable," "fiercely loyal," and a "cult following."[7] He is among the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema and has been featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list multiple times since 2012.[8][13] He is the recipient of a Filmfare Award and a SIIMA Award among other accolades.

Kalyan made his acting debut in the 1996 film Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi. Then, he had a streak of six consecutive hits, among which Tholi Prema (1998), Thammudu (1999), Badri (2000), and Kushi (2001) became back-to-back blockbusters. These films established Kalyan as a youth icon with a massive following distinct from his elder brother Chiranjeevi's fanbase.[4][6] In 2001, he became the first ever South Indian brand ambassador for Pepsi.[17] Kalyan later faced a slump, yet his popularity kept soaring despite the flops.[19] He made a comeback with Jalsa (2008), the highest-grossing Telugu film of that year, and continued with hits like Gabbar Singh (2012), Attarintiki Daredi (2013), Gopala Gopala (2015), and Bheemla Nayak (2022). He received the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for Gabbar Singh. Kushi and Attarintiki Daredi each held the record as the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time.

Kalyan holds a black belt in Karate.[20] In 1997, he was awarded the title "Pawan" by the Isshin-ryū Karate Association after a public martial arts demonstration.[21] He practices various martial arts, which he regularly showcases in his films both as a performer and an action choreographer. He is known as "Power Star" among his fans and the media.[22]

Kalyan is known for his extensive philanthropic efforts, across various social causes including orphan welfare, elderly care, disaster relief, healthcare, education, farmers' welfare, soldiers' welfare, parasports, arts, literature, and temple support.[23] He has provided financial support to both individuals in need and organizations. He founded the charity Common Man Protection Force in 2007.[26]

Kalyan entered politics in 2008 as the youth wing president of Chiranjeevi's Praja Rajyam Party, but left it after its merger with the Congress party. In March 2014, he founded the Jana Sena Party (JSP). He chose not to contest in the 2014 elections, but through his support and campaigns played a crucial role in the victory of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Andhra Pradesh.[27] In 2017, he brought national attention to the chronic kidney disease crisis in Uddanam.[28] He also led protests against forced land acquisition,[25] illegal mining in reserved forests, and marched for drought-affected farmers in Rayalaseema.[29][30]

In 2019, Jana Sena contested its first elections, winning only one MLA seat but garnered around 6% vote share. After the 2019 setback, Kalyan and JSP focused on issues such as farmer welfare, transparent governance, infrastructure, illegal sand mining, women's safety, land encroachment. In 2023, he launched a state-wide tour in his customized vehicle 'Varahi', aimed at strengthening the party's connection with the voters. In the 2024 elections, Kalyan was instrumental in forming an alliance between JSP, TDP and BJP.[31] The alliance swept to power in a landslide victory, with Jana Sena winning each of the seats it contested — 21 MLA seats and 2 MP seats. Kalyan was elected to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from Pitapuram constituency by a margin of over 70,000 votes and became the deputy chief minister.[29]

Early life
Pawan Kalyan was born as Konidala Kalyan Babu[32] on 2 September 1971[2] in a Telugu family to Konidala Venkata Rao and Anjana Devi in Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh.[36][37] Venkata Rao worked as a police constable and was transferred on a regular basis.

Kalyan was educated at the St. Joseph's High School in Nellore.[38] In 1997, he was awarded the title "Pawan" by the Isshin-ryū Karate Association after a public martial arts demonstration.[21][39] He also holds a black belt in Karate.[20]

Acting career
1996–1997: Early work
Kalyan made his acting debut in 1996 with Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi directed by E. V. V. Satyanarayana.[40] It was produced by Allu Aravind under Geeta Arts Banner, and co-starred Supriya Yarlagadda, granddaughter of Akkineni Nageswara Rao. The film employed a unique marketing campaign prior to its release. Initially, posters featuring Kalyan were released with the question, "Who is this guy?". Later, before the film's release, posters declaring "This is our Kalyan" further heightened audience interest.[41] Released in October 1996, the film was a moderate success at the box-office.[42] Kalyan’s performance and martial arts skills received significant attention.[43]

His second film Gokulamlo Seeta (1997), a drama film released the following year.[44] It was directed by Muthyala Subbaiah and starred Kalyan alongside Raasi and Harish. In the film, Kalyan plays a spoiled rich youth who transforms his reckless ways and fights against societal and familial opposition to win his love. Gokulamlo Seeta was the first film where Kalyan was credited as 'Pawan Kalyan' after he awarded the title "Pawan" in March 1997.[45] It was a commercial success.[46]

Kalyan's third film was Suswagatham (1998) directed by Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao and produced by R. B. Choudary under the Super Good Films banner. It starred Kalyan and Devayani (in her Telugu debut), with music composed by S. A. Rajkumar.[40] Kalyan was first credited with the title Power Star in this film.[47][48] In the film, Kalyan played a young man who loses everything due to his blind love for a girl. His performance in the film was critically acclaimed. Suswagatham sowed the seeds for Kalyan's rise to stardom. The film became a superhit at the box office.[46]

1998–2001: Success streak and superstardom
Kalyan's next film was Tholi Prema (1998), directed by A. Karunakaran and co-starring Keerthi Reddy with music by Deva. Karunakaran saw Pawan Kalyan's photo on a Telugu film magazine cover in Chennai and thought he was perfect for the lead in his romantic film. After sharing the script with Kalyan, Kalyan introduced him to producer G. V. G. Raju, who had worked with him on Gokulamlo Seeta.[49] The film was a major hit, launching Kalyan into stardom and becoming a classic romantic film in Telugu cinema.[50] It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu, six state Nandi Awards, and was featured at the 30th International Film Festival of India. The film was remade in Kannada as Preethsu Thappenilla (2000) and in Hindi as Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai (2001).[51][52]

In November 1998, there were reports of Kalyan collaborating with Malayalam director Fazil for a project to be produced by G. V. G. Raju, who had earlier produced Tholi Prema.[53] However, his next film turned out to be Thammudu, where he played the role of a kickboxer. Released in July 1999, Thammudu was written and directed by P. A. Arun Prasad.[54] The film collected a distributor share of ₹9.25–9.46 crore, emerging as a blockbuster and generating a profit of over ₹4 crores for buyers.[55][56] It became the second-highest-grossing film in the Nizam region after Choodalani Vundi (1998).[56] Kalyan's performance as a youth competing in a kickboxing contest was widely acclaimed.[54] The film's success led to it being remade in Tamil as Badri (2001), in Kannada as Yuvaraja (2001) and in Bengali as Champion (2003).[57]

Next, Kalyan acted in Puri Jagannadh's first directorial venture, Badri (2000). It starred debutants Ameesha Patel and Renu Desai (whom he would later marry). It was produced by T. Trivikrama Rao and the music was composed by Ramana Gogula.[58] The film became a blockbuster at the box office. Badri played a crucial role in expanding Pawan Kalyan's appeal from class audiences, who admired his earlier hits to a broader mass audience.[59] The intense scenes between Pawan Kalyan and Prakash Raj remain a significant highlight in Pawan's career.[59] The film's dialogues and songs were huge hits with the youth. The line "Nuvvu Nanda aithe nenu Badri Badrinath" and songs like "Ye Chikitha" and "Bangala Kathamlo" continued to be popular even after two decades.[60] Badri was later remade in Hindi as Shart: The Challenge (2004).[61]

Kalyan's next film was Kushi (2001) co-starring Bhumika. It was directed by S. J. Surya and produced by A. M. Rathnam.[62] Mani Sharma provided the score and soundtrack. Kalyan also choreographed all the action sequences in the film. Initially begun in 1999 as a bilingual along with its Tamil version, also titled Kushi (2000), the Telugu version was delayed due to Kalyan's prior commitment to Badri.[66] It was a blockbuster at the box office and went on to become the highest-grossing Telugu film ever at the time.[70] The film was critically acclaimed for its screenplay, music, cinematography and especially the performance of Pawan Kalyan.[71] Kushi was the culmination of a streak of six consecutive hits for Pawan Kalyan and his style, mannerisms and dialogues from the film were much imitated by the youth.[71]

The four consecutive blockbuster hits—Tholi Prema, Thammudu, Badri, and Kushi—had a cult status among youth at the turn of the millennium.[72] Pawan Kalyan became a youth icon, setting trends in action sequences, style, and fashion. These films gave him a massive fanbase, distinct from his elder brother Chiranjeevi's.[4][6] In 2001, Kalyan became the first South Indian brand ambassador for Pepsi, while Chiranjeevi promoted Coca-Cola.[14][75]

2002–2007: Directorial debut and career fluctuations
Kalyan's next film was Johnny (2003), which he wrote, directed, and starred in alongside Renu Desai.[76] Produced by Allu Aravind with music by Ramana Gogula, the martial arts film featured Kalyan as a coach who fights to fund his wife's cancer treatment.[77] Johnny had the highest theatrical distribution rights of ₹21 crore for a Telugu film at the time[78] and was released with over 250 prints worldwide.[79][80] Kalyan's clean-shaven look was a departure from his usual style which disappointed many fans.[81] Despite being Pawan Kalyan's first flop after six consecutive hits, the film was praised for its stylish and grounded action choreography.[82][83] Kalyan's styling from the film became a trend, with Johnny T-shirts, bandanas, armbands, and caps becoming very popular.[84] It was also screened at the International Film Festival of India.[80]

In 2004, his film Gudumba Shankar was released. The film was directed by Veera Shankar and produced by Kalyan's older brother Nagendra Babu under Anjana Productions banner.[85] Kalyan played the title role, wrote the screenplay and choreographed three songs. The action scenes were also conceived and choreographed by him. The film, starring Kalyan and Meera Jasmine, received mixed reviews and was an average performer at the box office. Kalyan's choreography of the realistic action scenes was praised. His unique style, including wearing double pants, grabbed attention at the time.[85][81]

His next film Balu (2005) was A. Karunakaran's second directorial starring Kalyan, after Tholi Prema. This film was produced by C. Aswini Dutt under Vyjayanthi Movies banner.[86] It co-starred Shriya, Neha Oberoi and Gulshan Grover. Balu was extensively filmed in Delhi and Agra, with a special set constructed near the Taj Mahal and another in Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad, at a cost of ₹90 lakh. Pawan Kalyan wore a unique pant in the film's flashback scenes, which he bought from Italy for about ₹2 lakh.[87] These pants later became a trend among the youth.[84][81] Balu was the first Telugu film to have a release in South Africa and became an average grosser at the box office.[88][89][90]

In May 2006, Bangaram, directed by Tamil filmmaker Dharani was released. It starred Kalyan in the title role and Meera Chopra, Sanusha, Ashutosh Rana, and Mukesh Rishi in supporting roles. The film was produced by A. M. Rathnam, who previously produced Kushi (2001). In the film, Pawan Kalyan plays Bangaram, a reporter who dreams of working for BBC. It received mixed to negative reviews.[91][92]

In March 2006, Pawan Kalyan’s second directorial venture, Satyagrahi (tagline: Satyame Naa Ayudham; transl. Truth is my weapon), featuring him in the role of a role of student union leader, was launched with a high-profile event at Annapurna Studios.[93] At the event, Kalyan expressed frustration with societal problems and aimed to use Satyagrahi to highlight these issues in a commercially appealing format. Producer A. M. Rathnam announced that the film would be made in Telugu and Hindi, with a Bengali dub.[93] Despite initial enthusiasm and notable collaborators like P. C. Sreeram and A. R. Rahman, the project was shelved. In October 2021, Kalyan revealed that the film, inspired by Jayaprakash Narayan's Emergency movement, was set aside to focus on real-life activism, finding it more fulfilling to address social issues directly rather than through cinema.[94]

Later that year, he appeared in Annavaram, directed by Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao, with Asin, and Sandhya were cast alongside him.[95] The film was produced under the Super Good Films banner and marked Kalyan's first role set in a rural background. Pawan Kalyan plays the title role of Annavaram, a black

These films established Kalyan as a youth icon with a massive following distinct from his elder brother Chiranjeevi's fanbase.[4][6] In 2001, he became the first ever South Indian brand ambassador for Pepsi.[17] Kalyan later faced a slump, yet his popularity kept soaring despite the flops.[19] He made a comeback with Jalsa (2008), the highest-grossing Telugu film of that year, and continued with hits like Gabbar Singh (2012), Attarintiki Daredi (2013), Gopala Gopala (2015), and Bheemla Nayak (2022). He received the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for Gabbar Singh. Kushi and Attarintiki Daredi each held the record as the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time.

Kalyan holds a black belt in Karate.[20] In 1997, he was awarded the title "Pawan" by the Isshin-ryū Karate Association after a public martial arts demonstration.[21] He practices various martial arts, which he regularly showcases in his films both as a performer and an action choreographer. He is known as "Power Star" among his fans and the media.[22]

Kalyan is known for his extensive philanthropic efforts, across various social causes including orphan welfare, elderly care, disaster relief, healthcare, education, farmers' welfare, soldiers' welfare, parasports, arts, literature, and temple support.[23] He has provided financial support to both individuals in need and organizations. He founded the charity Common Man Protection Force in 2007.[26]

Kalyan entered politics in 2008 as the youth wing president of Chiranjeevi's Praja Rajyam Party, but left it after its merger with the Congress party. In March 2014, he founded the Jana Sena Party (JSP). He chose not to contest in the 2014 elections, but through his support and campaigns played a crucial role in the victory of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Andhra Pradesh.[27] In 2017, he brought national attention to the chronic kidney disease crisis in Uddanam.[28] He also led protests against forced land acquisition,[25] illegal mining in reserved forests, and marched for drought-affected farmers in Rayalaseema.[29][30]

In 2019, Jana Sena contested its first elections, winning only one MLA seat but garnered around 6% vote share. After the 2019 setback, Kalyan and JSP focused on issues such as farmer welfare, transparent governance, infrastructure, illegal sand mining, women's safety, land encroachment. In 2023, he launched a state-wide tour in his customized vehicle 'Varahi', aimed at strengthening the party's connection with the voters. In the 2024 elections, Kalyan was instrumental in forming an alliance between JSP, TDP and BJP.[31] The alliance swept to power in a landslide victory, with Jana Sena winning each of the seats it contested — 21 MLA seats and 2 MP seats. Kalyan was elected to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from Pitapuram constituency by a margin of over 70,000 votes and became the deputy chief minister.[29]

Acting career
1996–1997: Early work
Kalyan made his acting debut in 1996 with Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi directed by E. V. V. Satyanarayana.[40] It was produced by Allu Aravind under Geeta Arts Banner, and co-starred Supriya Yarlagadda, granddaughter of Akkineni Nageswara Rao. The film employed a unique marketing campaign prior to its release. Initially, posters featuring Kalyan were released with the question, "Who is this guy?". Later, before the film's release, posters declaring "This is our Kalyan" further heightened audience interest.[41] Released in October 1996, the film was a moderate success at the box-office.[42] Kalyan’s performance and martial arts skills received significant attention.[43]

His second film Gokulamlo Seeta (1997), a drama film released the following year.[44] It was directed by Muthyala Subbaiah and starred Kalyan alongside Raasi and Harish. In the film, Kalyan plays a spoiled rich youth who transforms his reckless ways and fights against societal and familial opposition to win his love. Gokulamlo Seeta was the first film where Kalyan was credited as 'Pawan Kalyan' after he awarded the title "Pawan" in March 1997.[45] It was a commercial success.[46]

Kalyan's third film was Suswagatham (1998) directed by Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao and produced by R. B. Choudary under the Super Good Films banner. It starred Kalyan and Devayani (in her Telugu debut), with music composed by S. A. Rajkumar.[40] Kalyan was first credited with the title Power Star in this film.[47][48] In the film, Kalyan played a young man who loses everything due to his blind love for a girl. His performance in the film was critically acclaimed. Suswagatham sowed the seeds for Kalyan's rise to stardom. The film became a superhit at the box office.[46]

1998–2001: Success streak and superstardom
Kalyan's next film was Tholi Prema (1998), directed by A. Karunakaran and co-starring Keerthi Reddy with music by Deva. Karunakaran saw Pawan Kalyan's photo on a Telugu film magazine cover in Chennai and thought he was perfect for the lead in his romantic film. After sharing the script with Kalyan, Kalyan introduced him to producer G. V. G. Raju, who had worked with him on Gokulamlo Seeta.[49] The film was a major hit, launching Kalyan into stardom and becoming a classic romantic film in Telugu cinema.[50] It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu, six state Nandi Awards, and was featured at the 30th International Film Festival of India. The film was remade in Kannada as Preethsu Thappenilla (2000) and in Hindi as Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai (2001).[51][52]

In November 1998, there were reports of Kalyan collaborating with Malayalam director Fazil for a project to be produced by G. V. G. Raju, who had earlier produced Tholi Prema.[53] However, his next film turned out to be Thammudu, where he played the role of a kickboxer. Released in July 1999, Thammudu was written and directed by P. A. Arun Prasad.[54] The film collected a distributor share of ₹9.25–9.46 crore, emerging as a blockbuster and generating a profit of over ₹4 crores for buyers.[55][56] It became the second-highest-grossing film in the Nizam region after Choodalani Vundi (1998).[56] Kalyan's performance as a youth competing in a kickboxing contest was widely acclaimed.[54] The film's success led to it being remade in Tamil as Badri (2001), in Kannada as Yuvaraja (2001) and in Bengali as Champion (2003).[57]

Next, Kalyan acted in Puri Jagannadh's first directorial venture, Badri (2000). It starred debutants Ameesha Patel and Renu Desai (whom he would later marry). It was produced by T. Trivikrama Rao and the music was composed by Ramana Gogula.[58] The film became a blockbuster at the box office. Badri played a crucial role in expanding Pawan Kalyan's appeal from class audiences, who admired his earlier hits to a broader mass audience.[59] The intense scenes between Pawan Kalyan and Prakash Raj remain a significant highlight in Pawan's career.[59] The film's dialogues and songs were huge hits with the youth. The line "Nuvvu Nanda aithe nenu Badri Badrinath" and songs like "Ye Chikitha" and "Bangala Kathamlo" continued to be popular even after two decades.[60] Badri was later remade in Hindi as Shart: The Challenge (2004).[61]

Kalyan's next film was Kushi (2001) co-starring Bhumika. It was directed by S. J. Surya and produced by A. M. Rathnam.[62] Mani Sharma provided the score and soundtrack. Kalyan also choreographed all the action sequences in the film. Initially begun in 1999 as a bilingual along with its Tamil version, also titled Kushi (2000), the Telugu version was delayed due to Kalyan's prior commitment to Badri.[66] It was a blockbuster at the box office and went on to become the highest-grossing Telugu film ever at the time.[70] The film was critically acclaimed for its screenplay, music, cinematography and especially the performance of Pawan Kalyan.[71] Kushi was the culmination of a streak of six consecutive hits for Pawan Kalyan and his style, mannerisms and dialogues from the film were much imitated by the youth.[71]

The four consecutive blockbuster hits—Tholi Prema, Thammudu, Badri, and Kushi—had a cult status among youth at the turn of the millennium.[72] Pawan Kalyan became a youth icon, setting trends in action sequences, style, and fashion. These films gave him a massive fanbase, distinct from his elder brother Chiranjeevi's.[4][6] In 2001, Kalyan became the first South Indian brand ambassador for Pepsi, while Chiranjeevi promoted Coca-Cola.[14][75]

2002–2007: Directorial debut and career fluctuations
Kalyan's next film was Johnny (2003), which he wrote, directed, and starred in alongside Renu Desai.[76] Produced by Allu Aravind with music by Ramana Gogula, the martial arts film featured Kalyan as a coach who fights to fund his wife's cancer treatment.[77] Johnny had the highest theatrical distribution rights of ₹21 crore for a Telugu film at the time[78] and was released with over 250 prints worldwide.[79][80] Kalyan's clean-shaven look was a departure from his usual style which disappointed many fans.[81] Despite being Pawan Kalyan's first flop after six consecutive hits, the film was praised for its stylish and grounded action choreography.[82][83] Kalyan's styling from the film became a trend, with Johnny T-shirts, bandanas, armbands, and caps becoming very popular.[84] It was also screened at the International Film Festival of India.[80]

In 2004, his film Gudumba Shankar was released. The film was directed by Veera Shankar and produced by Kalyan's older brother Nagendra Babu under Anjana Productions banner.[85] Kalyan played the title role, wrote the screenplay and choreographed three songs. The action scenes were also conceived and choreographed by him. The film, starring Kalyan and Meera Jasmine, received mixed reviews and was an average performer at the box office. Kalyan's choreography of the realistic action scenes was praised. His unique style, including wearing double pants, grabbed attention at the time.[85][81]

His next film Balu (2005) was A. Karunakaran's second directorial starring Kalyan, after Tholi Prema. This film was produced by C. Aswini Dutt under Vyjayanthi Movies banner.[86] It co-starred Shriya, Neha Oberoi and Gulshan Grover. Balu was extensively filmed in Delhi and Agra, with a special set constructed near the Taj Mahal and another in Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad, at a cost of ₹90 lakh. Pawan Kalyan wore a unique pant in the film's flashback scenes, which he bought from Italy for about ₹2 lakh.[87] These pants later became a trend among the youth.[84][81] Balu was the first Telugu film to have a release in South Africa and became an average grosser at the box office.[88][89][90]

In May 2006, Bangaram, directed by Tamil filmmaker Dharani was released. It starred Kalyan in the title role and Meera Chopra, Sanusha, Ashutosh Rana, and Mukesh Rishi in supporting roles. The film was produced by A. M. Rathnam, who previously produced Kushi (2001). In the film, Pawan Kalyan plays Bangaram, a reporter who dreams of working for BBC. It received mixed to negative reviews.[91][92]

In March 2006, Pawan Kalyan’s second directorial venture, Satyagrahi (tagline: Satyame Naa Ayudham; transl. Truth is my weapon), featuring him in the role of a role of student union leader, was launched with a high-profile event at Annapurna Studios.[93] At the event, Kalyan expressed frustration with societal problems and aimed to use Satyagrahi to highlight these issues in a commercially appealing format. Producer A. M. Rathnam announced that the film would be made in Telugu and Hindi, with a Bengali dub.[93] Despite initial enthusiasm and notable collaborators like P. C. Sreeram and A. R. Rahman, the project was shelved. In October 2021, Kalyan revealed that the film, inspired by Jayaprakash Narayan's Emergency movement, was set aside to focus on real-life activism, finding it more fulfilling to address social issues directly rather than through cinema.[94]

Later that year, he appeared in Annavaram, directed by Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao, with Asin, and Sandhya were cast alongside him.[95] The film was produced under the Super Good Films banner and marked Kalyan's first role set in a rural background.
